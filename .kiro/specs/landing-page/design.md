# Design Document: Landing Page

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the JobFinder SaaS landing page. The landing page will serve as the primary marketing entry point, showcasing the platform's AI-powered assessment capabilities while providing seamless integration with the existing authentication system. The design prioritizes a modern, professional aesthetic consistent with the existing application while ensuring optimal performance and accessibility.

## Architecture

The landing page follows a component-based architecture using React with TypeScript. It integrates with the existing application structure and reuses the AuthForm component within a modal dialog pattern.

```

### AuthModal Component
Modal wrapper for the existing AuthForm.

```typescript
interface AuthModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  mode: 'signin' | 'signup';
  onClose: () => void;
  onModeChange: (mode: 'signin' | 'signup') => void;
}
```

## Data Models

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system-essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

Based on the prework analysis, the following properties have been identified:

### Property 1: Feature cards render with required elements
*For any* feature in the features array, the rendered feature card SHALL contain an icon, title, and description element.
**Validates: Requirements 3.1**

### Property 2: Steps render with required elements
*For any* step in the steps array, the rendered step SHALL display a number, icon, and description.
**Validates: Requirements 4.3**

### Property 3: User type cards contain required information
*For any* user type in the user types array, the rendered card SHALL display the target audience description and at least one benefit.
**Validates: Requirements 5.2**

### Property 4: Testimonials render with required fields
*For any* testimonial in the testimonials array, the rendered testimonial card SHALL display the quote, user name, and role.
**Validates: Requirements 6.2**

### Property 5: Footer links are grouped by category
*For any* footer link group, all links within that group SHALL be rendered under the correct category heading.
**Validates: Requirements 8.2**

### Property 6: Role-based redirect correctness
*For any* authenticated user with a valid role (TVET, ADOF, ADMIN), the redirect path SHALL match the expected dashboard path for that role.
**Validates: Requirements 9.2**

## Error Handling

### Modal State Errors
- If modal fails to open, log error and show toast notification
- Ensure modal can always be closed via escape key or clicking outside

### Navigation Errors
- If smooth scroll target doesn't exist, fail silently without breaking page
- Handle missing section IDs gracefully

### Authentication Errors
- Delegate to existing AuthForm error handling
- Display toast notifications for auth failures
- Maintain modal state on error to allow retry

### Responsive Breakpoint Handling
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities consistently
- Ensure no layout breaks at intermediate viewport sizes

## Testing Strategy

### Dual Testing Approach
This feature will use both unit tests and property-based tests to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Property-Based Testing
- **Library**: fast-check (JavaScript property-based testing library)
- **Minimum iterations**: 100 per property test
- **Tag format**: `**Feature: landing-page, Property {number}: {property_text}**`

Property tests will verify:
1. Feature card rendering invariants
2. Step rendering invariants
3. User type card content invariants
4. Testimonial card content invariants
5. Footer link grouping invariants
6. Role-based redirect mapping correctness

### Unit Tests
Unit tests will cover:
- Component rendering with various props
- Modal open/close behavior
- Navigation link click handlers
- CTA button click handlers
- Mobile menu toggle behavior

### Integration Tests
- Auth modal integration with existing AuthForm
- Successful sign-in redirects to correct dashboard
- Successful sign-up switches modal to sign-in mode
